# Mappy - An Activity Tracker App

![mappy-mock](https://github.com/john-aja/Activity-Tracker-Mappy/assets/95049418/d9766d8d-0f25-4d1a-a3d7-ebdb5d4e2b0e)

This is a simple activity tracker app developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to track their activities such as running or cycling, along with additional details like distance, duration, elevation, or cadence. The entered activity data is stored locally in the browser's storage, and the app displays the recorded activities in a sidebar as cards on the map.

## Technologies Used

The Mappy website is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: The structure and layout of the web pages are created using HTML.

- **CSS**: CSS is used for styling the user interface and making the website visually appealing.

- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is responsible for the functionality of the app, handling user interactions.

- **Leaflet API**: Integrated an interactive map API to allow users to select their starting point.

## Features 

- **Map Selection**: Upon opening the app, users are presented with a map where they can select the starting point of their activity.

- **Activity Form**: Once the user clicks on the desired starting location on the map, a form will open up. In this form, users can enter the details of their activity, including the type of activity (running or cycling), distance covered, duration, and additional metrics like elevation or cadence.

- **Local Storage**: The entered activity data is stored locally in the user's browser storage. This allows users to close the app and come back later without losing their recorded activities.

- **Sidebar**: The app features a sidebar that displays cards representing the activities that have been recorded. Each card contains summarized information about the activity, such as the type of activity, distance, duration, and other relevant metrics.
